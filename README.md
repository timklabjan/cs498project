# cs498project
We have two scripts to produce predictions, one based on an ensemble of classical machine learning algorithms (model_predictions_ensemble.py) and one based on a deep neural network (insert_here.py).

The pickle, sys, numpy, and pandas packages are necessary to run model_predictions_ensemble.py.
To obtain the predictions simply execute:
>python model_predictions_ensemble.py <path-to-dataset>
Results will be written to a file named "ensemble_output.txt"
