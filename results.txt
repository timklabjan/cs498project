With features presented as a bag of words and using a default logistic regression model, we obtain an accuracy of 0.288.
If we were to randomly assign topics 0-9 to the test data we obtain an accuracy of right about 0.10. Since the accuracy of the baseline model
is significantly greater than the accuracy of random guessing, we can conclude that the textual description of the content
does have predictive power in determining the topic of said content. With more advanced feature engineering and model tuning, we
should be able to obtain an accuracy greater than that of our baseline model.
